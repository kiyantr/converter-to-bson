Effortless Usage: Offers an intuitive and user-friendly API for conversion.
Installation:

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project directory.
Run the following command:
Bash

npm install converter-to-bson
```
Use code with caution.
Usage:

Import the CSharpBsonConverter class into your nodejs code:

```
import { ToBson } from 'converter-to-bson';
```

### Example using:

```
var jsonData = {
            $group: {
                _id: null, 
                "Example": {
                    "$sum": {
                        "$cond": [
                            {
                                "$eq": [
                                    "$date",
                                    ISODate("2023-12-31T17:00:00Z")
                                ]
                            },
                            {
                                "$sum": "$visits"
                            },
                            {
                                "$sum": "$new_visits"
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                },
            }
        };

const bsonData = ToBson(jsonData);
```

### Or like this:
```
var jsonString = `{
            $group: {
                _id: null, 
                "Example": {
                    "$sum": {
                        "$cond": [
                            {
                                "$eq": [
                                    "$date",
                                    ISODate("2023-12-31T17:00:00Z")
                                ]
                            },
                            {
                                "$sum": "$visits"
                            },
                            {
                                "$sum": "$new_visits"
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                },
            }
        }`;
const bsonData = ToBson(jsonData);
```
